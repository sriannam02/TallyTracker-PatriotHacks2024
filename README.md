## **Inspiration**
In high school, Scarlett, one of the founders of TallyTracker, found herself facing a big problem—a giant dance floor full of 50s dance costumes had her vision of organizing everything by size, and quality, color to facilitate garment distribution and size. However, the size of the closet and the sheer number of items made the project seem impossible. No matter how hard she tried, nothing was ever really sorted and she remembered the frustration of trying to categorize endlessly, how it felt like a lost cause. That memory inspired an ‘aha’ moment. What if there was a way to simplify inventory management for someone facing such a challenge? That’s when the idea for TallyTracker was bornIn high school, Scarlett, one of the founders of TallyTracker, found herself facing a big problem a giant dance floor full of 50s dance costumes had her vision of organizing everything by size, and quality, color to facilitate garment distribution and size.

## What it does
TallyTracker is an all-in-one inventory management app designed to help you organize, track, and optimize your inventory effortlessly. 

## How we built it
TallyTracker was developed using Python 

## Challenges we ran into
During the development of TallyTracker, one of the key challenges we faced was efficiently implementing the deletion feature for inventory items.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are incredibly proud to have developed TallyTracker as freshman students in mechanical engineering and cybersecurity. Despite our limited experience in coding and Python, we embraced the challenge and turned it into an opportunity to learn and grow.
